  "whoami": "I'm a Senior Software Engineer passionate about Cybersecurity and AI.",
  "p1": "Back in 2019, I did the Piscine at Codam (Amsterdam) and it was there I wrote my first ever lines of code. Since then, it's been a wild journey which has given me a wealth of hobbies and skills. During these years I've learnt many a thing about Software Engineering, Embedded Systems and Web Development (front-end and back-end).",
  "p2": "After finishing my Bachelor's, I worked at Panartis as a back-end developer, then returned to finish my Master's at 42 Paris. This is where I was exposed to AI and Cybersecurity, and two new flames were sparked. Now I work at Auguria.io as a Software Engineer and Data Engineer, building data clustering pipelines in Go, Python and Rust that process billions of records, managing Kubernetes deployments, and maintaining AWS infrastructure.",

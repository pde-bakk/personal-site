  "whoami": "I'm Cyber Security Engineer, graduated from Codam and 42Paris.",
  "p1": "Back in 2019, I did the piscine at Codam (Amsterdam) and it was there I wrote my first ever lines of code. Since then, it's been a wild journey which has given me a wealth of hobbies and skills. During these 2 years I've learnt many a thing about Software Engineering, Embedded Systems and Web Development (front-end and back-end).",
  "p2": "After finishing the Common Core (read: Bachelor), I was intrigued by AI and decided to make it my focus area. Because I also believed that every engineer should have at least some knowledge about Cyber Security (since it's becoming ever so important), I went ahead and also dived into Binary Exploitation and Reverse Engineering. That, combined with listening to tons of Darknet Diaries, has brought me to now pursue a career in Cyber Security.",

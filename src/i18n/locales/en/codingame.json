	"p1": "In 2020, when Covid first hit, our entire education went remote. This was a tall order for all of us who loved to work on Campus and rather struggled to motivate themselves to work from home.",
	"p2": "It was then, that the 42 Network decided to organize a small bot programming contest just for us. My friends and I loved it and put all our time in this.",
	"p3": "This contest was hosted on codingame.com who just so happen to organize these kinds of contests globally, twice a year. Since then, I have never missed an edition. I'm always looking forward to these challenges for months, and when they are over I feel a bit empty inside.",
	"p4": "Aside from just being tons of fun, this has helped me discover new interests in the tech field. And for that, Codingame, I thank you.",
	"p5": "They also offer a few other game-modes I'm enthralled with: Code golfing and Clash of Code. Clash of Code is a 15 minute game, where everyone gets the same exercise and has to solve it as fast as possible.",
	"p6": "Code golfing is writing a solution to the problem in as few characters of code as possible.",
	"p7": "Both of these game-modes I sucked at. I had friends who loved them, and reluctantly I gave them a try. And because I was pretty bad at them, I decided to grind it and now I'm top 100 in Clash of Code."
